## Contributing guidelines

 - create new branches from the dev branch*
 - name branches after your feature*
 - work on your branch until you're confident the feature is working*
 - create a pull request that can be reviewed, then merge into dev*
 - in the future we can run tests on dev, and when the build is passing we can merge into master*

*to be determined...*
